## What to inquiry
1. pain interactome:
(1) PENK, OPRL1, and GHRH were specifically enriched in the brain, FOS in the spinal cord, and CALCA, TRPV1, RUNX1, RUNX3, NTRK2, TNFRSF1A, and GDNF were enriched only in the PNS networks
(2) There are 8 enriched proteins that are more significantly regulated by others, for example, OPRM1, TRPV1, and FOS, and 4 proteins that more significantly regulate others: NGF, GHRH, PNOC, and LEP
